# Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis

Abstract

Breast Cancer has become the common cause of death among women. Manual diagnosis takes long hours for diagnosis and recurrence prediction of the breast cancer. This emphasizes the development of automated system for early diagnosis and fast treatment. Our aim is to classify whether the breast cancer is benign or malignant and predict the recurrence of malignant cases after a certain period. To achieve this we have used machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, KNN and Naive Bayes. These techniques are coded in MATLAB using UCI machine learning depository. We have compared the accuracies of different techniques and observed the results. We found SVM is most suited for predictive analysis and KNN performed best for our overall methodology.

Diagnosis of breast cancer is done by classifying the tumor. Tumors can be either benign or malignant but only latter is the cancer. Malignant tumors are more cancerous than the benign. Unfortunately, not all physicians are expert in distinguishing between the benign and malignant tumors. So we need a proper and reliable diagnostic system that can detect the malignant tumor. We also need a system that could predict the recurrence and non-recurrence of breast cancer from the malignant cases after the patient has undergone treatment for certain time period. The data available in manual diagnosis is noisy and raw that increases the cost of management of data. Thus there is a need of proper parameter and feature selection so that the error rate and cost is minimized.
